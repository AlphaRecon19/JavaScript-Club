# JavaScript Club

A series of lessons to improve existing JavaScript knowledge.

## Current Lessons

- 01: Basics (How to Program)

## Software Used

I use deck.js to handle the slides. This repository contains a version of
deck.js but I recommend going directly to the [deck.js GitHub
repository](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js/) if you want your own
copy - it will be far more up-to-date.

### Basic use

- Use left and right cursor keys to navigate back and forward
- Type `g` to open the "go to" menu and select a slide.

## License

The JavaScript Club files and lessons are licensed under the MIT License.
A very brief summary of the license can be found at [tl;dr
Legal](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) and full details can be found
in LICENSE.md.

Files that are **excluded** from this license are the deck.js files (located in
the "deck" folder). At time of writing, these files are also licensed under MIT
but the [deck.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js/)
should be checked for clarification as I do not own the copyright to that
software.
