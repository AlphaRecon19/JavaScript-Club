# JavaScript Club

A series of lessons to improve existing JavaScript knowledge.

## Current Lessons

- 01: Basics (How to Program)

## Software Used

I use deck.js to handle the slides. This repository contains a version of deck.js but I recommend going directly to the [deck.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js/) if you want your own copy - it will be far more up-to-date.

### Basic use

- Use left and right cursor keys to navigate back and forward
- Type `g` to open the "go to" menu and select a slide.
